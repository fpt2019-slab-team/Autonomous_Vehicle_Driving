Debug nets, which are already connected to System ILA IP core in the block-design, will be automatically available for debug in Hardware Manager.
For unconnected Debug nets, please open synthesized design and use 'Set Up Debug' wizard to insert, modify or delete Debug Cores. Failure to do so could result in critical warnings and errors in the implementation flow.
